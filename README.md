# Eye-Beast-Game
This inhospitable world is inhabited by a valiant hero/heroine - yourself - and five nasty dangerous monsters. The environment is populated by several blocks that the hero is able to push but the monsters cannot.  The hero is controled using the keyboard. It only moves horizontally and vertically (not diagonally). The goal of the hero is to push blocks around, trying to trap the monsters gradually, until there is no room left for them. The hero can push individuals blocks, as well as rows of blocks. However, any such a push only takes effect if there is an unoccupied cell where a block can move to. Another important point is that the blocks of the boundary are immovable, meaning that they cannot be pushed by the hero or the monsters.  The monsters have their own volition and they practice what the monsters most love to do: hero hunting. Each monster makes a move decision every second, more or less. They move through the free squares, one square at a time, horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The monsters are gelatinous and cannot push blocks. It is interesting to know that the monsters of the original game are only moderately smart. They do not need to very smart, since there are five of them attacking from all sides at the same time...  The game has only one level and the hero has only one life.
